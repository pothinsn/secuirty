DOC-2,Device Description,"The D-100 Hemoglobin Testing System uses the principles of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  A high-pressure pumping system delivers a buffer solution to an analytical cartridge and detector.  Whole blood samples undergo an automatic hemolysis and dilution process before being introduced into analytical flow path.  Prediluted samples are identified based upon the use of a microvial adapter in the sample pack, and the automatic dilution step is omitted.
A programmed buffer gradient of increasing ionic strength delivers the sample delivers the sample to the analytical cartridge where the hemoglobin species are separated based upon their ionic interactions with the cartridge material and the buffer gradient.  The separated hemoglobin species then pass through the flow cell where changes in the absorbance are measured at 415 nm and recorded as a digital chromatogram. 
The software performs an analysis of the hemoglobin peaks in the chromatogram, recording information including retention time, peak area, and relative area percent.  Any peaks that are identified as the target analyte(s) are calibrated before generating a sample report and chromatogram for each sample.  The software includes an optional feature (Advisor) that compares the sample report against a set of rules that are programmed to take user-specified actions.
